## Jorge Graphic & Web Designer

Hi, I'm **Jorge Rodríguez**, I've been working as a **Developer and Web Designer** since **2010**. Over the years, I’ve collaborated with various companies, both as a freelancer and within teams.

I have had to develop some projects from scratch and others already started, as well as redesign some already finished, always looking to **implement new tools and technologies** that allow me to obtain **the best result**.

To make this possible, I also dedicate myself to researching and learning about everything related to **new web development technologies**. This learning process has been part of my life for quite some time now and I hope it will be **for much more**.
